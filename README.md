-⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡                 Fun fact:                    ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
- Water H2O ... Hydrogen 1 Atom *2H, Oxygen 8 *1H.. so 2 + 8 = 10.. {funny 1 & 0 are the 2 parts of our binary system and a bit has 8 Numbers}
- 0 celsius freezing point on Sea level +4 celsius the maximum density of water (Water expands under 4 c again.. like a few other elements)
- -273,15 °C absolute minimum temperature which is 0 in Kelvin.. 2.728 Kelvin Kelvin has the cosmic background radiation today since the big bang..
- 27.32 Days travels the Moon around our planet once... 250 and 285 days between ovulation and childbirth for a Human, which is something around 10 times Moon around planet.
- 28 days periods on average across the entire adult population..
- 1 / 27,32 = 0.0366032 inverse value... 366 days evry 4 jears.. if it has reached 100, it is skipped, if it can be divided by 4, the leap year takes place as 1600. 2000 etc.
- 1 / 273.15 gas expands when it is heated from 0 C to 1 C
- π(1+p)=4  or  p=(4/π-1)  or  π=4/(1+p)=4/1,2732=3,14169 or 4 / π = 1.27323954474 or p ≈ 0,273 Plichta-Konstante
- 2,724 km earth diameter the moon 3,474 km.. 12,724 / 3,474 = 3.66263672999 or 3,474 / 12,724 = 0.2730273498899717
